\section{Conclusion}
\label{conc}

We have implemented a SimCLR and RotNet framework to compare their performance as an image classifier on limited labeled data from the CIFAR-10 dataset. SimCLR performed better than RotNet as a linear classifier, whereas RotNet in its semi-supervised setting outperformed all other models.
