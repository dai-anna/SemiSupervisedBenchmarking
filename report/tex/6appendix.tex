\section{Appendix}

\paragraph{Contributions by team-members} The team-members made the following contributions to the project:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Anna Dai} - Creating the SimCLR framework, linear evaluation of Resnet-20 encoder for SimCLR
    \item \textbf{Tigran Harutyunyan} - Creating the RotNet framework, linear evaluation and semi-supervised training for RotNet
    \item \textbf{Deekshita Saikia} - Creating the SimCLR framework, tuning and pre-training of Resnet-20 encoder for SimCLR
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Code} The code for this project can be accessed in \href{https://github.com/dai-anna/SemiSupervisedBenchmarking}{this GitHub repository}.

\paragraph{Peer Review} We vote team D5 for best poster, named 'Contrastive Representation Learning using SimCLR and RotNet frameworks'. The poster presents results on the performances of these approaches under different self-supervised settings. The poster is well organized with plots to support their hypothesis. A variety of experiments were run and are well-balanced with their conclusions.
